    "text": "This activity is meant to provide an interactive environment for students to implement what they have learned from the videos. Question types include the following:\n‚Äì Text Box: A space for students to write down answers to open ended questions. These questions are followed by a Solutions tab to reveal the answer.\n‚Äì Your Turn: These coding questions ask students to explore / edit / manipulate existing to code. These questions are followed with an Expected Solutions box so students can get immediate feedback\n‚Äì Demo: These coding questions have the solutions within them and allow the students to run the code and make connections.\n\n\n   \nIn this mini analysis we work with the data used in the FiveThirtyEight story titled ‚ÄúThe Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood‚Äôs Exclusion of Women‚Äù.\nThis analysis is about the Bechdel test, a measure of the representation of women in fiction.\n\n\nWe‚Äôll use: tidyverse for majority of the analysis and scales for pretty plot labels later on.
