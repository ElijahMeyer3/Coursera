Question types include the following:\n– Text Box: A space for students to write down answers to open ended questions. These questions are followed by a Solutions tab to reveal the answer.\n– Your Turn: These coding questions ask students to explore / edit / manipulate existing to code. These questions are followed with an Expected Solutions box so students can get immediate feedback\n– Demo: These coding questions have the solutions within them and allow the students to run the code and make connections.\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n  🟡 Loading\n    webR...\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nIn this mini analysis we work with the data used in the FiveThirtyEight story titled “The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood’s Exclusion of Women”.\nThis analysis is about the Bechdel test, a measure of the representation of women in fiction.\n\n\nWe’ll use: tidyverse for majority of the analysis and scales for pretty plot labels later on.
